Version 1.0
===========

First official release.

Known issues:

+    Syntax file:
    +    does not support tables
	+    doesn't match reference link ids with spaces
+    Supertab completion of citations won't work until after
     you've invoked omnicompletion of citations at least once
	 using CTRL-X CTRL-O

To be added:

+    Support for multiple bibliography files
+    Dictionary style completion of citations (show author/title)
     in popup.
+    Complete citations based on keyword, not just citekey (e.g., 
     type something like `@word` to match any bib entry that
	 contains 'word'.)
+    Support for using Zotero (both locally and via zotero.org)
     instead of a local static bibliography file.
