# Vim Plugin for Pandoc

This is a bundle of pandoc-related stuff that I've thrown together for
my own use. I don't really know what I am doing, so use at your own
risk! If you make any changes or improvements, let me know.

This documentation is only nominally formatted as a vim help file;
really it is just markdown with a few vim help file tags between
asterisks. (Someone want to write a vim-help writer module for pandoc?)

I'd recommend that, in addition to reading this help file, you take a
look at the heavily commented ftplugin/pandoc.vim file.

## Known Gotchas

1.  Filetype detection does not play well with the [markdown-vim
    plugin][].
2.  Conversion commands assume you are using OS X (should be easy to
    fix).
3.  At various places, I assume that paths are POSIX paths, which will
    cause trouble on Windows (should be easy to fix).
4.  No vim help files.

## Help From Others

Thanks to both [Felipe Morales][] and [Wei Dai][] for lots of bug fixes
and improvements. Special thanks to Felipe, who has made dramatic
improvements to the syntax file.

## Stuff From Elsewhere

The syntax file was originally by jeremy schultz (found [here][]) as
githubbed by [wunki][]. Originally, this repository was a fork of
wunki's repository. But now that it has grown significantly beyond that,
I've "de-forked" it.

The snippets file, for use with [snipMate][], is a slight extension of
the markdown.snippets file that is part of many of the [vim-markdown
repositories on github][].

I implemented autocompletion by hacking away at [LaTeX Box][]'s
implementation. The results don't look much like the original, but I
learned a lot from copying.

## Features

Here are some key features:

-   Applies settings to make vim a pleasant writing environment.
    -   soft word wrapping
    -   intelligent line joining
    -   pandoc-powered tidying up
    -   other little tweaks along these lines

Specifically:

    setlocal formatoptions=1
    setlocal linebreak
    nnoremap <buffer> j gj
    nnoremap <buffer> k gk
    vnoremap <buffer> j gj
    vnoremap <buffer> k gk
    setlocal display=lastline
    setlocal nojoinspaces
    setlocal commentstring=<!--%s-->
    setlocal comments=s:<!--,m:\ \ \ \ ,e:-->

Additional tweaks welcome. Feedback also welcome on whether this is
appropriate. It would be easy to make some or all of this optional.

-   Syntax highlighting with support for definition lists, numbered
    examples, delimited code blocks, LaTeX and HTML, citations,
    footnotes, ....

-   Some snippets for use with snipMate (I never use these, so they
    could probably use improvement. If you improve them, let me know).

-   Folding of ATX styled sections. (See `:help fold-commands` if you
    haven't used vim's folding before.). Quick tips:

    -   `za` toggles folds open and closed (`zA` toggles fold and all
        its children open and closed)
    -   `zc` closes a fold (`zC` closes it and all its children)
    -   `zo` opens a fold (`zO` opens it and all its children).

-   Autocompletion of citations (more details below).

-   Some simple pandoc-powered conversion and tidying functions.

ftplugin/pandoc.vim is fairly well-commented. Take a look at it to see
what it does in detail.

## Global Settings

The plugin recognizes two global settings, which can be set in your
vimrc:

-   g:PandocBibfile. If this is set to the path to a bibtex file (a MODs
    file should also work), then that file will be used for citation
    autocompletion.

So, for example, one might put something like this in your vimrc:

    let g:PandocBibfile = "/Users/david/Documents/mybib.xml"

-   g:PandocLeaders. If this variable exists, then this plugin will go
    ahead and define some leader mappings.

So, for example, I have this in my vimrc:

    let g:PandocLeaders = 1

## Citation Autocompletion

*pandoc-citation-completion* *PandocBibfile*

If you have a bibtex file (or a symlink to a bibtex file) named
'default.bib' in one of these folders,

    ~/.pandoc
    ~/Library/texmf/bibtex/bib
    ~/texmf/bibtex/bib

then the plugin will automatically use that file for citation
autocompletion. If you define `g:PandocBibfile` in your vimrc,

    let g:PandocBibfile = '/the/path/to/your/bibtex/file.bib'

then that file will be used instead.

To use autocompletion, start typing a citekey, e.g.,

    @geac

and then, while still in insert mode, hit ctrl-x ctrl-o (vim's shortcut
for omnicompletion), and you'll get a popup window with a list of
matching keys, e.g.,

    @geach1970
    @geach1972

Regular expressions work too (but not with SuperTab for some reason):

    @le.*90

should suggest both '@leftow1990' and '@lewis1990', assuming those are
both keys in your bibliography.

The plugin also provides support for using this with [SuperTab][]. I
have the following in my vimrc:

    let g:SuperTabDefaultCompletionType = "context"

With this setting, I can just hit TAB in the middle of typing a citation
to autocomplete the citation.

> **KNOWN BUGS**:
>
> -   SuperTab autocompletion of citations only works after I use ctrl-x
>     ctrl-o autocompletion once within a given file.
> -   Regular expressions don't work when using SuperTab.

> **TODO**: I'd like to pandoc.vim to be smarter about finding
> bibliography files. This includes:
>
> -   finding the local texmf tree programatically
> -   using (all?) bibtex files found in any of the search paths.
> -   including the directory that the file is in among the search paths
> -   better support for other bibliography database formats (the parser
>     currently works with bibtex and MODS xml files, but the script
>     doesn't look for MODS xml files).

## Dictionary-Based Citation Completions

I am leaving this in for now, but now that proper autocompletion is
working, I'll probably get rid of it. If you create a text file,

    ~/.pandoc/citationkeys.dict

that contains a list of citation keys, one per line, like so

    @adams1967a
    @adams1971
    @adams1972a
    @adams1974
    @adams1977
    @adams1986a

these citekeys are added to vim's dictionary, allowing for
autocompletion by typing part of a citekey, e.g.,

    @adams19

and then hitting ctrl-x ctrl-k (or via SuperTab).

## Conversion and Tidying Up

*MarkdownTidy* *MarkdownTidyWrap* *MarkdownHtmlOpen* *MarkdownPdfOpen*
*MarkdownOdtOpen*

Look at the comments in ftpugin/pandoc.vim to see what is there. I've
made no attempt to provide a complete set of commands. The more I use
vim, the less inclined I am to provide basic conversion commands, since
it is easy to do something like

    :!markdown2pdf %

If there is a particular conversion that you do all the time with a
particular set of options, you might want to define a <leader> mapping
in your vimrc.

The plugin sets

    setlocal equalprg=pandoc\ -t\ markdown\ --reference-links

In practice, this makes it easy to hard-wrap paragraphs nicely, using
vim's `=` command. If you prefer soft wrapping, you might want to change
this to

    setlocal equalprg=pandoc\ -t\ markdown\ --reference-links\ --no-wrap

Either way, there are a few gotchas to be aware of:

1.  The filter will remove pandoc's title block, if that is included in
    the chunk of filtered text.
2.  The filter will apply and remove any latex macros you might have
    defined, if they are included in the chunk of filtered text.

So keep your metadata and macros at the top of the file, and avoid
filtering them with `=`.

Advice welcome on how to work around these problems.

## Leader Mappings

*pandoc-leader-mappings* *PandocLeaders*

If you define `g:PandocLeaders` in your vimrc,

    let g:PandocLeaders = 1

then the plugin will define some leader mappings for you. The ones I use
the most are

    <leader>pdf
    <leader>odt
    <leader>html

which convert the buffer to the relevant format and open the results.
